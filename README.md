# Blood-Donation-Club-Backend
### This is a blood donation app. It's only created for a blood Donor help through which blood donors can easily donate blood, and those who need blood can And they will be able to find blood donors at their district and upazila levels easily.

## Now, here comes how to use the blood donation web application

First, you need to open an account here, which can be done using a Gmail account or a phone number. An OTP will then be sent to the associated Gmail account or phone number, which must be verified within 5 minutes; otherwise, the account will be automatically deleted. Then again, you have to register.

Since we are not yet able to deploy our backend system to the premium version, it will be somewhat challenging to open an account with Gmail. So, you will create an account phone number, please.

If you want to set up the account within 30 days of opening it, and if it is not filled 100%, you will have to delete it again after 30 days. Because if the account is not set up completely, then those who need blood cannot easily find the donor and get all their information.

This application is being made to assist those who truly need blood and are in critical need. Only those who are authentic users and really donate blood will be placed here after verification.
